OpenGPU Objectives

OpenGPU is committed to transforming the landscape of distributed Large Language Model training. Our core objectives guide our journey towards creating a powerful, community-driven AI research tool. Here's what drives us:
Stay Fully Open Source

    Commitment to Openness: Ensure all software and tools developed remain open source, fostering transparency and collaboration.

Be Dynamic

    Community-Supported Flexibility: Adapt to the fluid nature of community contributions, with GPUs being added or removed from the cluster regularly.

Deployable on a Mass Scale

    Scalability: Achieve the capability to efficiently manage up to 40,000 GPUs in a single cluster.

Fast, Lightweight, and Optimized

    Performance Efficiency: Prioritize speed and optimization without compromising on the lightweight nature of the software.

Be Simple

    Ease of Setup: Ensure that even individuals with minimal technical expertise can set up and contribute to the project on Windows and Linux environments.

Be Secure

    Robust Security Measures: Safeguard the integrity of the project and protect volunteers' machines from any potential threats. Prevent any malicious activities that could contaminate data or training processes.
