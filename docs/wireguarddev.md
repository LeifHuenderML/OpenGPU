Central Configuration Management

To manage a dynamic set of peers, consider using a central configuration management system. This could be a simple server or service that all WireGuard instances report to and fetch configurations from.

    Central Server: Holds the current state of all active WireGuard peers (IPs and public keys).
    Dynamic Configuration Generation: Write a script or service on the central server that generates WireGuard configuration files dynamically based on the current set of peers.

2. Automated Peer Registration and Configuration Updates

    Registration Script on Each Peer: Write a script for each peer that sends its public key and possibly its current IP to the central server.
    Configuration Update Mechanism: Develop a mechanism for peers to periodically check the central server for configuration updates. This can be achieved through cron jobs or a background service on each peer.

3. Secure Distribution of Keys

    Public Keys: Only public keys are shared with the central server and among peers. Each peer keeps its private key secure and private.
    Security Measures: Implement secure communication channels (like HTTPS) for transmitting public keys to the central server.

4. Handling IP Address Changes

    Dynamic DNS or Similar Services: For peers with frequently changing public IPs, consider using Dynamic DNS services. Each peer updates its current public IP with a Dynamic DNS service, and the central server uses these dynamic DNS records to keep the configuration up to date.
    Periodic Updates: Peers can periodically send their current public IPs to the central server to update their records.

5. Script to Generate WireGuard Configurations

    Write a script on the central server that:
        Collects current peer information (public keys, IP addresses/DNS names).
        Generates WireGuard configuration files for each peer.
        Distributes these configuration files to the respective peers or makes them available for download.

6. Automating WireGuard Interface Updates

    On each peer, automate the process of fetching the latest configuration from the central server and applying it to the WireGuard interface.
    This could involve periodically running a script that downloads the latest configuration and restarts the WireGuard interface.

7. Monitoring and Logging

    Implement logging on the central server to track peer changes and configuration updates.
    Regularly monitor the system for any issues or anomalies.

8. Fallback Mechanisms and Error Handling

    Ensure there are fallback mechanisms and robust error handling in your scripts and processes to handle communication failures, misconfigurations, or other unexpected issues.

Example Workflow

    Peer Joins: When a new peer joins, it registers its public key and IP/DNS name with the central server.
    Configuration Update: The central server updates its list of peers and regenerates WireGuard configurations for all peers.
    Configuration Distribution: Each peer periodically fetches its latest configuration and applies it.
